# Java-Machine-Learning
#### Simple Machine Learning library for a better understanding of concepts.<br>This is going to be based in a standard supervised Neural Network.<br><br>
<hr>

### First update (16/05/19)
 * Implementation of modularity (some classes and some packages to set a bit of order).
 * Succesful *stable* topology thanks to the modularity.
 * Standard **Forward pass** stable to run.
 * New package to create topologies called [Controllers](https://github.com/Jose-Robles/Java-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Controllers)
 * Two new packages to run Neural Networks:
   * [AlphaDeployment](https://github.com/Jose-Robles/Java-Machine-Learning/tree/master/AlphaDeployment) in order to debug and play.
   * [BetaDeployment](https://github.com/Jose-Robles/Java-Machine-Learning/tree/master/BetaDeployment) in order to get onnly the result and to give the user a cleaner environment.

### First release (09/01/19)
 * Tried to create the topology.
 * Planed the logic of the forward pass to get some response.
 * Both under construction.

###### Note: By now it still incompleted, I'll be updating it to make it worthful and useful.
